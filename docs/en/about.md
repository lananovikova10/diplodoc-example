## Core concepts

### HttpClient
HttpClient is the core class for making HTTP requests. It supports multiple methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.

### Coroutine Support
Stream is built to work seamlessly with Kotlinx Coroutines, allowing for efficient asynchronous network requests and response handling.

### Flow Integration
Stream enables the use of Kotlin Flow for managing streaming responses, which is ideal for handling large or continuous data updates.

[*Kotlinx-Coroutines]: Kotlin Coroutines are a concurrency design pattern that allows you to write asynchronous code as if it were synchronous. They provide a way to perform tasks in parallel without the need for complex thread management or callback chains, making your code more straightforward and easier to understand.
